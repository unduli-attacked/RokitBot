BUGS:
- search feature is questionable at best
- readability of dates is meh
- links not hyperlinking??
- make formatting of launches and events match

FEATURES:
- search by date
- add args to next and prev functions (ex. "r!nextLaunch 2" would return the 2nd closest launch, and so on)
- function to list next 10 upcoming launches/events (name and date)
- "this day in launch history"
- countdown for upcoming launches/events
- Out There: assemble multistream views for launches/events
- Slightly Less Out There: save links to user-created multistreams and provide them on command
- "day in space" (picks a random space news article published today from the spaceflight news api)
